== About Ribbot

Standard online forums often lead to low quality discussions. Sites like Hacker News, Reddit, StackOverflow, and 37Signals Answers have pioneered a new format for forums that leads to higher quality content. They are characterized by a number of features including post ranking, user reputation, crowd sourcing, and threaded discussions.

Ribbot seeks to allow any company or online community to setup a similar forum and build a high quality community online.

Ribbot was created by Brian Armstrong in 2011 in San Francisco, CA.

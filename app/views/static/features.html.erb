<h1>About Ribbot</h1>
<p>Standard online forums often lead to low quality discussions.  Sites like Hacker News, Reddit, StackOverflow, and 37Signals Answers have improved on the basic forum with a combination of user reputation and voting features, and their communities have benefited greatly.</p>
<p>Ribbot seeks to allow any company or online community to setup a similar forum and build a high quality, fun community.</p>
<p>Ribbot was created by Brian Armstrong in 2011 in San Francisco, CA.

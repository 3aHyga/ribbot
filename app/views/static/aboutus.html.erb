<h1>About Impact</h1>
<p><br>
  Impact was started in 2004 by a group of students who wanted to change what entrepreneurship meant. Where owning your own business was previously seen as a last resort for students who couldn't get into a school or program of their choice, it is now becoming a career that is encouraged and promoted to students. We're absolutely honoured and privileged to have been able to play a part in being catalysts of that change.<br>
  <br>
  As a result, over the past few years, conferences, speakers, and programs have sprouted and connected aspiring entrepreneurs with experts, veterans, and opportunities. <br>
  <br>
  We remain 100% committed to helping youth think entrepreneurially, and connecting high-potential youth with the opportunities that they require to experience entrepreneurship. Unlike many organizations, we decided to start practising what we were preaching, and build innovation, sustainability, and scalability into everything we do from now on -- very much like any successful startup would.<br>
  <br>
  Impact's programs included the beloved National Conference, Microcredit, Apprentice, FuEL Awards, Impact Infused, and the Impact Gala. Now, we will be focusing on a new frontier: Impact.org. We are continually evolving, and always push to stay ahead of the curve. We see this as a natural progression for Impact. Where conferences, events, and speeches all come to an end, this community will continue to build, grow and flourish.<br>
  <br>
  The Impact community will be taken online, to a place where we can always congregate and continue to meet, chat with, and encourage each other. We thank you for joining us on the ride, and hope you continue to explore this frontier with us. </p>
